# Rust web graphics exploration

This project is my journey through exploring the posibilities of rendering graphics in a web setting with rust.
It currently follows the Learn web gpu for rust tutorial.

## Local development

Have rust, bacon, wasm-pack, npm and vite installed.

Then run these two sets of commands in two terminals:

cd rust && bacon wasm
cd web && npx vite
